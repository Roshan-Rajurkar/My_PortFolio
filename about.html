            <div class="text">
                <p>Hello!<span> My name is Roshan</span> and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My
                    interest in web development started back in 2021 when i decided to try editing custom themes --
                    turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fast-forward to today, and I've the privilege of making fabulous websites and <span>worked with some
                        corporations</span>.
                    My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for
                    variety of <span>users</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also recently created a <span>tic-tac-toe</span> game along with <span>digital clock, portfolio site</span> and many other
                    projects using technologies such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript,
                    And also learning React to Up-skill my front-end development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently :
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>&cir; JavaScript (ES6)</td>
                        <td>&cir; HTML</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>&cir; CSS</td>
                        <td>&cir; React</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>&cir; WordPress</td>
                        <td>&cir; ...more</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
